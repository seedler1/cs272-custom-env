# Constructing Observations From Environment States
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Since we will need to compute observations both in ``reset`` and
# ``step``, it is often convenient to have a (private) method ``_get_obs``
# that translates the environment’s state into an observation. However,
# this is not mandatory and you may as well compute observations in
# ``reset`` and ``step`` separately:

    def _get_obs(self):
        return {"agent": self._agent_cards, "villain": self._villain_cards,
                "cards": self._cards, "pot": self._pot, "agent_stack": self.agent_stack, 
                "vilain_stack": self.villain_stack}

# %%
# We can also implement a similar method for the auxiliary information
# that is returned by ``step`` and ``reset``. In our case, we would like
# to provide the manhattan distance between the agent and the target:

    def _get_info(self):
        return {
            "distance": np.linalg.norm(
                self._agent_location - self._target_location, ord=1
            )
        }
        
# %%
# Oftentimes, info will also contain some data that is only available
# inside the ``step`` method (e.g. individual reward terms). In that case,
# we would have to update the dictionary that is returned by ``_get_info``
# in ``step``.

# %%
# Reset
# ~~~~~
#
# The ``reset`` method will be called to initiate a new episode. You may
# assume that the ``step`` method will not be called before ``reset`` has
# been called. Moreover, ``reset`` should be called whenever a done signal
# has been issued. Users may pass the ``seed`` keyword to ``reset`` to
# initialize any random number generator that is used by the environment
# to a deterministic state. It is recommended to use the random number
# generator ``self.np_random`` that is provided by the environment’s base
# class, ``gymnasium.Env``. If you only use this RNG, you do not need to
# worry much about seeding, *but you need to remember to call
# ``super().reset(seed=seed)``* to make sure that ``gymnasium.Env``
# correctly seeds the RNG. Once this is done, we can randomly set the
# state of our environment. In our case, we randomly choose the agent’s
# location and the random sample target positions, until it does not
# coincide with the agent’s position.
#
# The ``reset`` method should return a tuple of the initial observation
# and some auxiliary information. We can use the methods ``_get_obs`` and
# ``_get_info`` that we implemented earlier for that:

    def reset(self, seed=None, options=None):
        # We need the following line to seed self.np_random
        super().reset(seed=seed)

        # Choose the agent's location uniformly at random
        self._agent_location = self.np_random.integers(0, self.size, size=2, dtype=int)

        # We will sample the target's location randomly until it does not coincide with the agent's location
        self._target_location = self._agent_location
        while np.array_equal(self._target_location, self._agent_location):
            self._target_location = self.np_random.integers(
                0, self.size, size=2, dtype=int
            )

        observation = self._get_obs()
        info = self._get_info()

        if self.render_mode == "human":
            self._render_frame()

        return observation, info

# %%
# Step
# ~~~~
#
# The ``step`` method usually contains most of the logic of your
# environment. It accepts an ``action``, computes the state of the
# environment after applying that action and returns the 5-tuple
# ``(observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info)``. See
# :meth:`gymnasium.Env.step`. Once the new state of the environment has
# been computed, we can check whether it is a terminal state and we set
# ``done`` accordingly. Since we are using sparse binary rewards in
# ``GridWorldEnv``, computing ``reward`` is trivial once we know
# ``done``.To gather ``observation`` and ``info``, we can again make
# use of ``_get_obs`` and ``_get_info``:

    def step(self, action):
        
        if action == 1: # If the agent decides to check
            pass
        elif action == 2: # If the agent decides to raise
            pass
        elif action == 3:# If the agent decides to raise
            pass
        
        
        
        
        # Map the action (element of {0,1,2,3}) to the direction we walk in
        direction = self._action_to_direction[action]
        # We use `np.clip` to make sure we don't leave the grid
        self._agent_location = np.clip(
            self._agent_location + direction, 0, self.size - 1
        )
        # An episode is done iff the agent has reached the target
        terminated = np.array_equal(self._agent_location, self._target_location)
        reward = 1 if terminated else -1  # Binary sparse rewards
        observation = self._get_obs()
        info = self._get_info()

        if self.render_mode == "human":
            self._render_frame()

        return observation, reward, terminated, False, info        
    
# %%
# Close
# ~~~~~
#
# The ``close`` method should close any open resources that were used by
# the environment. In many cases, you don’t actually have to bother to
# implement this method. However, in our example ``render_mode`` may be
# ``"human"`` and we might need to close the window that has been opened:

    def close(self):
        pass
